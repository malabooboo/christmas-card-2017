Once again the kids had to adjust to moving, which meant new schools. But they are used to being flexible and have adjusted quickly to their new/old life.

After 2 years of "high school" in the UK school system **Caleb** is back at middle school!  He made the 8th grade basketball team, and though he had been enjoying not having to wear a British school uniform anymore, in a cruel twist, he ends up having to wear a tie on game days!

**Tyler** is in 3rd grade and loving his new school. In only his first month back at Tae Kwon Do, he's already moved up a belt!

**Tayte** is in 1st grade and is also enjoying his first experience in an American school.  He's become good friends with the next-door neighbor and plays with him almost every day.

Aside from the family trips this year, **Tim** got a chance to go on a photography trip to Iceland with and 2 friends from high school. He is now back working at Google HQ, playing hockey again on his former team, and is enjoying being able to watch Sharks and Niners games during normal hours.

While still in the UK, **Chesney** split her time in 2017 between serving as VP of Communications of American Women of Surrey, social media expert at a friend's cafe, and a local supply teacher.  She's excited to resume teaching ASL at West Valley College for the spring semester.

Here's to more adventures in 2018!

We've included some of the highlights of our travels in 2017 here (Click on a photo for more details).
