2017 was another year of transition for us, as we said goodbye to England, our home for 2 and half years, and headed back to California.  We loved living in the UK and made the most of the time we had, filling our free time with as many vacations as possible.  We're grateful for the opportunity we were given to go out on our own as a family and move house to the other side of the world--it was truly a special time.  We already miss all the friends we made along the way!

Now that we're back in Scotts Valley, we are enjoying the benefits of being close to family, especially during the holidays!
